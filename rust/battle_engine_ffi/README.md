This is the Rust module for the BattleEngine.

It is used to process battles with millions of units efficiently with
the least amount of memory as possible and is on average 200x faster than doing the same from PHP.

This Rust library is called from PHP via FFI (Foreign Function Interface) in the `RustBattleEngine` class.
